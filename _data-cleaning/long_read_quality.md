# Introduction

Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore technologies sequencing platforms produce long reads. Both platforms have unique challenges with regards to quality control. In this section I will walk through using a variety of tools to assess the quality of reads or raw data generated by these platforms.


# Pacbio Sequence Data

Raw pacbio data can be in two formats. The first is a BAM file containing the raw full-length passes of the sequencing which includes subreads, errors, primers, and the smart bell sequence. The second file format are fastq sequences in which the subreads have been collapsed into consensus sequences and hopefully contain few errors. See below for some images summarizing this. 

{% include gallery id="gallery_pacbio" %}

## Downloading data
 
Pacbio CLR data from a *Stichopus chloronotus* genome sequencing project can be downloaded using the following command.
```bash
# creating conda environment for NCBI's sra tools
conda create -n sratools
conda activate sratools
conda install -c bioconda sra-tools 

# downloading the sra and bam files
# the -X is setting the largest file size to 100 gigabytes
prefetch -X 100G SRR8499555,SRR8499556,SRR8499557,SRR8499558

# this is to extract the fastq files from the sra files
fasterq-dump *.sra
```

Conveniently, this downloads both the compressed fastq files in sra format and the subread.bam files, aka pacbio raw data. However, when running the fastq files through nanoplot or fastqc there are no phred scores.

## SequelTools

Raw pacbio data can be in two formats. The first is a BAM file containing the raw smartbell sequences aligned to themselves. A great tool for checking the stats of the subread bam files is [SequelTools](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532105/). The github page for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/SequelTools)

## Installing sequeltools
which is a pain. I am always surprised to come across well made tools that don't have conda packages available. There is no version associated with the tool. So whatever was available on 17 January 2022. 
```bash
# downloading the github respository and making the files executable
git clone https://github.com/ISUgenomics/SequelTools.git
cd SequelTools/Scripts
chmod +x *.sh *.py *.R

# making it callable from the command line
export PATH=$PATH:/home/jon/Working_Files/sea_cuke_species_data/stichopus_chloronotus/SequelTools/Scripts

# creating a conda environment for installing dependencies
conda create -n sequeltools
conda activate sequeltools

conda install -c anaconda python 
conda install -c conda-forge r 
conda install -c bioconda samtools 

# my desktop was missing a ubuntu library
sudo apt install libncurses5

# requires a text file containing a list of subread.bam file locations.
# change directory to whereever your subreads.bam files are and run this command
find $(pwd) -name "*subreads.bam"  > subFiles.txt

# and finally we can run it. 
SequelTools.sh \
  -p a \
  -n 40 \
  -t Q \
  -u /home/jon/Working_Files/sea_cuke_species_data/stichopus_chloronotus/pacbio/sra/SRR8499556/subFiles.txt
```
Note: I ran into some dependency troubles when using conda to install python, r, and samtools. If you don't install in the correct order you might end up with incompatible versions and errors such as I was getting below

```bash

# Error number 1 
Running in NO_SCRAPS mode

  File "/home/jon/Working_Files/sea_cuke_species_data/stichopus_chloronotus/SequelTools/Scripts/generateReadLenStats_noScraps.py", line 37, in Mean
    mn = float(sum(listx)) / float(len(listx))

# Error number 2

/home/jon/miniconda3/envs/sequeltools/lib/R/bin/exec/R: error while loading shared libraries: libreadline.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

```

The first one is a samtools version problem. The second error is a problem with whatever version of R I had installed. Specifically it didn't like the readline package version. I removed the conda environment, recreated it, and tried various orders of installation until one worked. Not sure why, but the version that is currently working for me can be found below

```bash
python                    3.10.2          h62f1059_0_cpython    conda-forge
r                         4.0             r40hd8ed1ab_1004    conda-forge
r-base                    4.0.5                h9e01966_1    conda-forge
samtools                  1.14                 hb421002_0    bioconda
```

The current version of sequeltools only outputs pdf files, that's not very helpful for adding photos to this website so I converted the pdfs to jpeg using poppler per this guy's blog [post](https://jdhao.github.io/2019/11/14/convert_pdf_to_images_pdftoppm/) 

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge poppler

# and a simple bash loop over all the files in a directory.
# It will complain about some files not being pdf. that's fine

for file in *;
do 

pdftoppm -singlefile \
	-png \
	$file \
	$file
done
```
Note: you could also just edit the R script for plotting these graphs and change the pdf to png and tweak the output. I didn't as it felt like more effort. 


{% include gallery id="gallery_sequeltools" %}

Cool. So I am only showing graphs from one of the pacbio sra from ncbi. Going from left to right. Subread length ranges from very short to near 50kb long with an N50 sitting near 20kb and the total number of bases produced by each run ranged from 4000b to 7000mb. Just to note these are subreads, meaning they haven't been collapsed into consensus sequence fastq file and represent raw data.

{% include gallery id="gallery_sequeltools_2" %}

"PSR (polymerase to subread ratio) is the total bases from the longest subreads per CLR divided by the total bases from subreads. This is a measure of the effectiveness of library preparation. When PSR is close to one the DNA template is mostly the reads of interest, whereas a total failure of library preparation would result in no reads of interest and a PSR of zero." Based on this excerpt from the sequeltools paper, the PSR of these runs are probably acceptable. 

ZOR (ZMW occupancy ratio) is calculated as the number of CLRs with subreads divided by the number of subreads. This is a measure of the effectiveness of matching DNA templates with ZMW’s. When ZOR is zero there are no DNA templates in ZMWs. When ZOR is above one then there are more than one DNA template per ZMW on average; ideally,
this value is exactly one." Based on this excerpt from the sequeltools paper, the ZOR is also probably ok.


# Oxford Nanopore Technologies' Sequence Data

![](/assets/images/data_cleaning/long_read_quality/nanopore_dna.jpeg){: .align-right width="400px" height="400px"}  Data created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms is fundamentally different than Pacbio raw data. As a DNA sequence goes through a biological nanopore, it changes an electrical signal which can be interpretted to represent different bases. The resulting data is stored in Fast5 format. Although recent [publications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01147-4) suggest this may change. As there is no fast5 formatted sea cucumber data available on NCBI we will have to settle with analyzing nanopore data that has been "basecalled" already. Meaning an algorithm as interpretted the signal generated by the dna traveling through the pore and written the results to a fastq file. The image to the right gives an example of what this looks like.  

## Downloading data

To download the long read data from NCBI for the genome sequencing project of *Chiridota heheva* see below
```bash
conda activate sratools
prefetch SRR15466781
cd SRR15466781
fasterq-dump *.sra
```
## Nanoplot

The tool that I like to use for investigating the ONT read data is called [Nanoplot](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty149/4934939) and more information can be found on their github [page](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot)

## Installing and running Nanoplot
version nanoplot-1.39.0
```bash
conda create -n nanoplot
conda activate nanoplot
conda install -c bioconda nanoplot
```

running nanoplot
```bash
NanoPlot \
	-t 50 \
	-f png \
	--fastq SRR15466781.fastq
```

Note: Nanoplot has a number of options depending on what kind of data it is working with. For example, if your ONT data was basecalled usning Minknow then additional information is stored in the fastq headers which Nanoplot can extract and plot. Unfortunately, this long read data does not have that information. 

## Results

Nanoplot creates a number of images to peruse, even when run using a standard long read fastq file as input. Additionally, it produces some excellent interactive html files. The interactive results can be found [here](/nanoplot_report/). Additionally, it should be noted that the basic nanoplot fastq function can also be used on fastq files from pacbio. 

```bash
Mean read length:                 14,604.5
Mean read quality:                    10.3
Median read length:               10,817.0
Median read quality:                  10.5
Number of reads:               2,905,301.0
Read length N50:                  22,295.0
STDEV read length:                13,118.4
Total bases:              42,430,388,059.0

>Q7:	2905299 (100.0%) 42430.4Mb
>Q10:	1914609 (65.9%) 28655.4Mb
>Q12:	126422 (4.4%) 1402.9Mb
>Q15:	7 (0.0%) 0.0Mb
Top 5 highest mean basecall quality scores and their read lengths
1:	15.7 (388)
2:	15.5 (485)
3:	15.3 (308)
4:	15.2 (216)
5:	15.2 (193)
```

So a total of 42 gigabases of data with a median length of 10kb and Q10 phred score. Importantly 28.65 gigabases or 66% of the data had a phred score above Q10. Highest quality reads topped out at Q15 and those were all shorter than 400 bases long. 

As far as data quality goes, that ain't great. It means there is likely an error every ten bases or an accurate base calling rate of ~90%. It is usable? oh ya. Now let's take a look at some of these pretty plots generated by nanoplot. 


{% include gallery id="gallery_nanoplot" %}

Starting left and going right. First plot has average read quality on the Y axis and read length on the X axis. It gives a nice scatter plot of quality vs length. In addition it has histograms of the length and quality. Read length seems to be bimodal - meaning there are two peaks. Quality has a classic bell shape, showing a normal distribution with a slight skew towards higher quality values. There is nothing with a phred score less than 6 so this makes me think the data has been trimmed already. The second graph is a closer look at the previous plot. The far right graph shows the read length vs number of bases. This gives us an idea where the bulk of bases are located - in long vs shorter reads. The rest of the graphs below are close ups of the histograms essentially.
