### Is it worth it? 

I was talking with some friends recently about my animal photosynthesis post and the question was raised - "Is it even worth it?". Let's say we somehow do enable humans to photosynthesize, would it produce enough sugar/atp to make a dent in our daily metabolic needs? 

Let's use the brain as a frame of reference. The brain primarily consumes glucose and can account for up to 30-40% of our daily caloric need. In [childhood](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13010.short), it can consume up to 66% of the resting metabolism. According to this biochemistry textbook on NCBI's [website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/), the brain needs about 120 grams of glucose daily. 

Now we need some numbers for skin area, number of whatever cell type we want the chloroplast in, and volume of said cell. According to harvard's [B10Numbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=100578&ver=1), humans typically have 1.6-1.8 square meters of skin. This depends on how tall or large you are and for simplicities sake, we are going to say our experimental subject actually had an area of 2 square meters. 

Next we need to decide cell type. The cells of the epidermis seem like the logical location for photosynthesis to occur. It is also worth noting that epidermal cells all orignate from the stratum basale and migrate up through the epidermis until they become dead skin cells that make up the stratum corneum. So chloroplasts would be present in all epidermal cells and would photosynthesize throughout their life. Since all the cells of the epidermis are the same cell type at different stages of development, we will use keratinocyte as the cell of choice for our estimations. 

According to a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X1530556X) published in 2002, there are roughly 75,346 nucleated epidermal cells per a square millimeter. 1 m² = 1000000 mm² so (2)(75,346)(1000000) which is 150,692,000,000 cells that might be photosynthesizing. Now we need a rough volume, which is a bit trickier because the volume of an epidermal cell changes throughout it's life. However, one [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15452534) published in 1971 found a mean cell volume for cells in the intermediate stage to be 750 cubic micrometers. 

Plants have a wide range of cell sizes and chloroplast and chlorophyll concentrations. For this naive approach we will use data from arabidopsis. The primary photosynthesizing cell volume is [4000 cubic micrometers](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/5/11/1661/5984619?login=true). This is roughly 5.3 times larger than then the average keratinocyte. The average arabidopsis cell contains [100 chloroplasts](https://rsscience.com/chloroplast-function-and-structure-solar-panels/). Each chloroplast has 1.75 * 10^-9 mg of chlorophyll per a chloroplast according to a [study on brassica](https://tohoku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=65038&item_no=1&attribute_id=18&file_no=1). 

If we figure keratinocytes have a fifth of the amount of chloroplasts, but roughly the same amount of chlorophyll per a chloroplast then the amount of total chlorophyll would be (20 chloroplasts/cell)(1.75*10mg^-9 chlorophyll/chloroplast)(150,692,000,000) = 5274.22 milligrams of chlorophyll. 

We know that the rate of carbon fixation per a milligram of chlorophyll per an hour is 100 micromoles CO2. We also know the relationship of CO2 to sugar produced which is 6 H2O + 6 CO2 + energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. If we have (5274.22 milligrams of chlorophyll)(100 micromoles CO2)= 527,422 micromoles fixed. We know that it takes 6 molecules of CO2 to make 1 glucose so there would be 87903.66 micromoles of glucose produced per an hour. This turns out to be 15.8364 grams per an hour. If we were to run around outside, butt naked in full sun then we would produced our brains daily need in 7-8 hours.
