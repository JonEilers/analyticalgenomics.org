# Why did I make this website? 

In the upcoming years genome assembly is going to explode. There are millions of species and many more individuals of those species that need their genomes sequenced and we now have the ability to do that. This will become especially true when long read sequencing becomes cheap with the advent of solid state nanopore sequencing. However, the tools and knowledge to assemble and annotate a genome are scattered across scientific papers, github repositories, and academic institutions. My goal is to distill the basics into one website that is understandable and accessible. 

Here I have detailed the tools I've used and the process I go through to create genome assemblies, predict genes, and analyze results. When reading these walk-throughs, keep in mind that it's a rare day when everything works the first time. More time is spent troubleshooting installation problems and learning how to use a tool than is spent actually using the tool. So if you find yourself struggling to get things working, rest assured, that's a battle we all fight everyday.
