### The Photosynthetic Human

While mountaineering this past weekend I tried distracting myself from the agony by thinking about what it takes to engineer photosynthesis into animals. Now this is certainly not a new idea. It's a common troupe in science fiction and anime such as found in [Knights of Sidonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Sidonia). It also occasionally pops up in popular science pieces such as this [article](https://www.livescience.com/what-if-humans-had-green-skin-photosynthesis.html) by Charles Choi. But any serious inquiry into this possibility is quickly met with a cold dose of reality - Biology is complicated. This certainly hasn't stopped scientists from dreaming though and coming up with terrible names such as [Planimal cells](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cytologia/83/1/83_830103/_article/-char/ja/)

There are some animals that are known to incorporate chloroplasts from their diet into their cells such as this [sea slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica) and research is [ongoing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33077025/)) regarding how they are able to do this. But sadly, humans are unable to do this. 

If we are to ever achieve this goal, the first thing we would have to do is somehow add an additional plastid into our skin cells or modify our current one: Mitochondria. The latter was explored in a 2013 [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01635) in which they added rhodopsin protein, a light driven proton pump, into mitochondria and demonstrated that light activated the pump. The majority of photosynthesis on earth is actually done by [algae and bacteria](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1181277) in the ocean using rhodopsin proteins to generate hydrogen proton gradients which then power an ATP synthase protein. This produces ATP from ADP and is not surprisingly, the foundation for photosynthesis in plants.

But back to the topic at hand: how to get our skin to photosynthesize. First we need a little background: there are two major steps. The first was just described. This is where photons are captured and the energy used to strip a hydrogen proton from water. That proton is then used to power a ATP synthase protein. This is not unlike what happens in mitochondria, but rather than light as a fuel source, glucose is used. 

The second step involves a protein called Rubisco which captures CO2 and splits the C and O2 using the excess ATP generated by the first photosynthesis reaction. The resulting molecule can then be turned into sugar. 

Simple right? Find a way to add a new plastid to skin cells and make sure ATP synthase, rubisco, and their axillary components are there. Alas, if only. Nothing in biology is simple. But this thought process did give me something to think about. So what are some problems with adding photosynthesis to humans?

1: The light and dark reactions of photosynthesis occur in and require a specialized plastid. These plastids are like mitochondria in that they can replicate by dividing. Additionally, the nuclear genome has no genes for making these plastids. So these plastids would have to be injected into a fertilized egg if we want them to become germline inherited. Plastids were symbiotic bacteria once upon a time, so this is not unheard of. There is even a case in which the [amoeba Paulinella](https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-c2b4e2e0-105f-4ffd-ae8f-74fe4cb1d794) recently acquired a new endosymbiont. At least one study has looked into the possibility of adding an endosymbiont into human cells. In this [experiment](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018877) cyanobacteria were injected into human cells with no detrimental side affects. When the gene invasin was engineering into the cyanobacteria they were able to evade the immune system and even replicated within macrophage cells. 

2: If a photosynthetic plastid were to be somehow added to the germline, it would need to be only present in skin cells. If they were to be present in all cells of the body like mitochondria are they would essentially be parasitic to those cells as there would be no light. In plants, chloroplasts are usually relegated to the inner layers of leaves. However, they are also repurposed for [starch storage in roots](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11120-020-00765-4) in addition to other uses such as [amino acid synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast#Amino_acid_synthesis). So other possible uses could include synthesis of essential amino acids that humans are not normally capable of making. Additionally, inheritance of this plastid would likely fall to the maternal line as is the case with mitochondria and insuring it's presence in egg cells would be essential. 

3: If photosynthesis were to occur in the skin, transportation of the sugar to other parts of the body would be crucial. While our skin is highly vascular, how rapidly it would be able to conduct glucose away would need to be determined. The best cells to house these plastids would likely be the same cells responsible for skin color, melanocytes. Most light waves are able to penetrate to this depth. At least if this [graphic](https://rosemarycottageclinic.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-penetration-by-wavelength.png) is to be believed. 

4: The photosynthesis production of ATP and sugar would need to be tightly regulated. During periods of intense photosynthesis genes responsible for rapid transport of glucose and handling the toxic effects of high oxygen would need to be upregulated. There would also be an increased need for water during photolysis step of the light dependent reactions. During periods of low light or water, the system would need to be downregulated to prevent damage. 

This thought experiment is absolutely fascinating to think about. Plants solved many of these problems hundreds of millions of years ago and would most definitely be a source of inspiration for how to integrate photosynthesis into human cells. There are likely hundreds of genes involved in regulating and performing the steps necessary for photosynthesis and would require precise genetic engineering. While I can't promise it, I will likely revisit this topic in more detail in the future. Ideally diving into the genetics of each step and where these could be placed in the human genome and how to regulate them. Until then, here is an [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166918301526?casa_token=wgSCytYmGAgAAAAA:i68Y4zFjcFnL4hl3VkxgS1aRWNBDn3kib84c97Ry5FG4lIeD-VqPLQXQiTSK5xSm7MYnOIHeo6E) looking at how scientists having been modifying plastids to serve other purposes.
