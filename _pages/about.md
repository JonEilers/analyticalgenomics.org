![](/assets/images/IMG_9855.jpg){: .align-right width="300px" height="300px"}  While a masters graduate student at Walla Walla University. My topic of study was the sea cucumber *Apostichopus californicus*. The goal of my thesis was to sequence, assembly, and annotate the genome of *Apostichopus californicus* in order to provide a critical tool for future research into their genetics. 

  At first, I wanted to investigate the expression of specific genes involved in their regenerative abilities. However, this enthusiasm was quickly stymied when I found little genetic information in the literature. That is when I decided it was time to remedy this problem and lay the foundation for future research. I sequenced and assembled a draft genome of *Apostichopus californicus* for my master's thesis.

  When I am not reading papers, performing experiments, or doing computational analysis, I am out hiking, running, shredding tunes on my flute, reading science fiction, and otherwise musing about the future. If you want to talk science or are interested in my research feel free to contact me. I enjoy a lively discussion over a cup of coffee.
