There are two sides to sequencing a genome: The wet lab and the dry lab. The wet lab is what we traditionally think of as research and involves chemicals, special equipment, and working with tissues or cells. Dry lab on the other hand is what takes place once the data has been collected and computational methods applied to make the data useful. 

Just like in wet lab research, a lab notebook is essential for recording what I did, mistakes, thoughts, etc. However, unlike wet lab research, dry lab is not linear or constrained by limited supplies and often the same computation is run multiple times with slightly different parameters. For this reason, I have split the dry lab notebook into separate sections for each step involved in creating a high quality draft genome. 

Additionally, I will only be recording the final commands and results along with any notes on installation and dealing with problems. Programs often have to be rerun due to mistakes or the output not being quite what I wanted. Including it would clutter the page and make following the process difficult. 

My notes and thoughts can be found on this [page](/drylab_notes/) where I will keep track of my thoughts and what I am planning on doing next. Commands and results will be located in the subpages.
