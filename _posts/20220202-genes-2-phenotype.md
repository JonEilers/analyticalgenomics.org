excerpt: "Translating sea cucumber healing abilities to humans"


# The magical properties of animals

Humans have a penchant for thinking that an animals ability to do something or how it looks can magically be transferred to humans if we eat it or turn it into a "medicine". A sad, humerous, and I wish it wasn't true example is how some people believe a Rhino's horn will [help with erectile dysfunction](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180514095509.htm) because it is erect and pointy. Sea cucumbers also have this honor as their ability to heal and regenerate has led to them being turned into [skin beauty products](https://www.amazon.com/BEAUUGREEN-FIRMING-SOLUTION-CUCUMBER-HYDROGEL/dp/B07DR6R1SR). 

While smearing pulped sea cucumber on my [skin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229918304485) isn't very appealing, it does beg the question "how do we go from the genetics of sea cucumber healing to medicine for humans?" 

# Understanding Sea Cucumber Healing and Regeneration

what do we know so far
-  genetics
-  proteomics
-  studies looking for medicinal properties


See below for some examples of studies that have used gene expression to study the sea cucumbers during various points during healing. But how does this translate to human healing? 

[Wnt Signaling Pathway Linked to Intestinal Regeneration via Evolutionary Patterns and Gene Expression in the Sea Cucumber Apostichopus japonicus](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00112/full) 
- studied gene expression after sea cucumber eviscerated and at different time points of the healing. 
- Wnt, Frizzled, Dvl, GSK-3β, β-catenin, Axin, APC, and c-Myc, is the only pathway contains genes that all detected among regenerative species.
- Among the seven regeneration-related signaling pathways, the Wnt signaling pathway was the only one with DEGs enriched
- The expression knockdown of Wnt7 and Dvl significantly inhibited the intestinal regrowth in comparison to that injection of dsEGFP, suggesting Wnt7 and Dvl were functional important in intestinal regeneration 

[The Effect of Sea Cucumber Extract (Holothuria scabra) on the Proliferation of Human Placenta Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells](https://research.usc.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/The-Effect-of-Sea-Cucumber-Extract/99451329502621)
- The H. scabra protein extracts at low doses did not show any toxicity to PL-MSCs, moreover they could increase the cell number at the range of 0.01 μg/ml to 25 μg/ml. The treatment of 0.1 and 1 μg/ml of H. scabra extracts increased the proliferative rate of MSCs when compared with control.

[Identification and localization of growth factor genes in the sea cucumber, Holothuria scabra](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021024737)
- We postulated that the H. scabra extracts might contain growth factors that regulate cell generation in the sea cucumbers. This implication might provide a new treatment for cell and tissue injury in humans, especially when the endogenous pathways might have been lost.
- In this study, we performed an in silico search of growth factors and their related-receptors in H. scabra radial nerve (RN) cord and body wall transcriptomes [51, 52]. Growth factor proteins deduced from H. scabra transcriptomes were identified and compared with their homologs in vertebrates, invertebrates, and other echinoderm species, showing their conservation within metazoans. Moreover, some growth factors were selected, and their expression was examined throughout H. scabra tissues using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization.

# Applying to Humans

how does it apply to humans
- how do the genetics/proteomics of sea cucumber healing translate to humans
- what does the future hold, will better technology allow us to better translate it

Take the above genes/pathways and compare them to humans. How are they different?
