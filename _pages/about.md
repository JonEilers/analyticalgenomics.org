![](/assets/images/IMG_9855.jpg){: .align-right width="300px" height="300px"}  While a masters graduate student at Walla Walla University. My topic of study was the sea cucumber *Apostichopus californicus*. The goal of my thesis was to sequence, assembly, and annotate the genome of *Apostichopus californicus* in order to provide a critical tool for future research into this species' genetics. 

At first, I wanted to investigate the expression of specific genes involved in their regenerative abilities. However, this enthusiasm was quickly stymied when I found little genetic information in the literature. That is when I decided it was time to remedy this problem and lay the foundation for future research. I sequenced and assembled a draft genome of *Apostichopus californicus* for my master's thesis.

After finishing my master's thesis I decided to turn this website into a gentle introduction to genome bioinformatics. While there is a great number of papers and biostar posts on genome bioinformatics, it requires already being something of an expert in order to make sense of the information. I hope to somewhat remedy this  with this website by breaking down genome assembly and annotation into its basic steps and presenting the programs, results, and interpretation for each step.  

When I am not reading papers, performing experiments, or doing computational analysis, I am out hiking, running, shredding tunes on my flute, reading science fiction, and otherwise musing about the future. If you want to talk science or are interested in my research feel free to contact me. I enjoy a lively discussion over a cup of coffee. 

If you are working on, want help with, or have questions about genome assembly or annotation projects please feel free to reach out to me.
