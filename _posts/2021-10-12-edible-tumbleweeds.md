Tumbleweeds: nothing is as iconic as the tumbleweed is to a spagehtti western. Few people know though that the iconic tumbleweed of the western US is an introduced weed from russia called [*Kali tragus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_tragus) or more commonly known as Windwitch or prickly russian thistle. This weed, while iconic, is also both a bane and bone to the western US - according to wikipedia, this plant can help with habitat rehabilitation by providing shade to young plants and acting as mulch and food for soil microbes. It also is a fire hazard and has a habit of accumulating in ditches, stream beds, road sides, and other places and serve as excellent tinder for fire. 

This past weekend I was out hiking through the [Ancient lakes](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/ancient-lakes) of washington and got to thinking about ways to deal with invasive species that don't require either people intensive or herbicide intensive work. This led me to wondering about how hard it would be to create an "edible" version of a tumbleweed, make it not easily dispersed, and also able to control local populations of tumbleweed through interbreeding and hybrid sterilization.

Let's start with the first of the three criteria - edibliness. Tumbleweeds are initially grazable for lifestock when young, tender, and green. But as they grow they become woody and their spines stifen up. Removing the spines and decreasing the woodiness of the stem would result in a much more delectable plant for grazers. For humans, I suspect we'd want a bit more substance. The path of least resistence for making an edible tumbleweed would likely be modifying the root stucture into something with higher starch, maybe more carrot like. This [review](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/68/16/4433/4103066?login=true) offers an excellent introduction to what we know about starch synthesis and transport. 

Additionally, the thorns will have to go. Thorns are essentially small branches that terminate before leafing out. In this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220307557) researchers were able to disrupt two genes: THORN IDENTITY1 (TI1) and THORN IDENTITY2 (TI2) in citrus. This disruption resulted in the thorns continuing to grow and leaf out into branches rather then terminating into pointy bits. Removing the thorns would make the tumbleweed more likely to be chewed on by herbivores. 

Tumbleweed being a thistle, it become woody and dies later in the season. This is a problem. Once woody, not much will want to chew on it. It dying is also problematic as once it dies it will eventually break off from the roots and become the iconic tumbleweed. So we have some choices - we can try reducing how woody it gets or we could try preventing it from dying. 

Changing a plant from an annual to a pereneal has been a dream of many farmers and scientists for decades. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in creating perenial [grain crops](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/7/2192) and a great deal of effort and planning has gone into making it [happen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138520300534). The genetics behind the different life strategies is still being elucidated. However, there are several candidate pathways including miR156/SPL in which the miR156 rna represses flowering which allows for plant growth. Another candidate is the TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) gene which ["prolongs vegetative development"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110218-024638#_i9). This gene also determines whether axial shoots will become flowers or remain vegetative. However, the actual mechanism behind perennialism is not known.
