# Introduction 
I am in eastern Mojave desert visiting my Fiance while she does a emergency medicine rotation in Arizona. While she is at work I am roaming the deserts with an eye for understanding life at extremes and also looking for scorpions. While scouring google maps for interesting locations in the region I noticed something odd: industrial farming. google maps revealed large scale irrigation pivots in the middle of the mojave desert. These pivots were right next to an area that I was interested in so off I went to investigate. 

(insert photo of the irrigation pivot)

Once I got out there I realized the complete insanity of it. This [article](https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2019/12/05/biggest-water-users-arizona-farms-keep-drilling-deeper/3937582002/) summarizes it nicely. In Arizona, all you need is a permit to drill a well, no one tracks how much water is used by each farm or limits them either. This is in a desert with an average rainfall of [3.5 inches](https://www.sidmartinbio.org/what-is-the-average-rainfall-of-the-mojave-desert/) meaning the aquifers the farms are pulling from are not being replenished and no one knows exactly how much each farm is pumping. 

While this approach to farming the desert is absolute idiocracy, deserts are not immutable. They come and go as the climate changes. The Sahara cycles between [lush grassland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period) and extreme desert due to changes in monsoons and the earth's oscillation. This change occurs about every [20,000 years](https://news.mit.edu/2019/study-regulating-north-african-climate-0102), forcing the plants and animals to rapidly adjust or go extinct. 

The key to changing the weather and ecosystem of a region is complexity. This can be seen in the Amazon rainforest where the trees transpire so much they create their own [rain and climate](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-71039/latest.pdf). However, it requires a large number of trees to generate "moisture recycling". But the simply act of planting trees or shrubs with complex architecture can have significant impacts on the ecosystem. For example Saugoro cactus practically require a ["nurse plant"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1111/0033-0124.5504008?casa_token=pWUYTkaHKW4AAAAA%3ATOB63C0dgIb6L8I0wcw29AGNnJS7G5_ok_l73TmkUFP0B2YijphRJz2HyovXf3gMY8Lp7pi5H1RaMQ) to grow under in order for them to become established and reach maturity due to the extreme environment they grow in.
