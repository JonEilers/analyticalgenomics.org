| 6 | | plugs|
| 18 | ml| PMSF/TE solution|
| 36 | ml | TE solution |

#### Protocol
1. Mix 18 ml of TE solution with 18 microliters of PMSF solution 
2. Remove EDTA solution from plugs
3. Add 1 ml PMSF solution and wait for 1 hr
4. Repeat step 3 two more times
5. Remove PMSF solution and add 1 ml TE solution and wait for one hr
6. Repeat step 5 two more times
7. Add TE and store plugs

#### Notes
* apparently PMSF is breaks down in TE solution after 30 mins. So PMSF needs to be added when TE is added to the plug tube, not before
