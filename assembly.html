excerpt: "Assemblying a genome is like putting together a million piece puzzle"
---
<p> Genome Assembly is a computationally expensive and complex process. There are hundreds if not thousands of different software packages and algorithms which attempt to improve the speed and accuracy of assembling fragment sequence data. </p>

<p> Most scientists will try a number of different programs and pick the best assembly produced. You will find my thoughts, attempts, and code below. </p>

<ul>
  {% for protocols in site.assembly %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ protocols.url }}">{{ protocols.title }}</a></h2>
       </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
