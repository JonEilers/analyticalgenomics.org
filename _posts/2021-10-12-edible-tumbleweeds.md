Tumbleweeds: nothing is as iconic as the tumbleweed is to a spaghetti western. Few people know though that the iconic tumbleweed of the western US is an introduced weed from Russia called [*Kali tragus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_tragus) or more commonly known as Windwitch or prickly Russian thistle. This weed, while iconic, is also both a bane and bone to the western US - according to Wikipedia, this plant can help with habitat rehabilitation by providing shade to young plants and acting as mulch and food for soil microbes. It also is a fire hazard and has a habit of accumulating in ditches, stream beds, road sides, and other places and serve as excellent tinder for fire. 

This past weekend I was out hiking through the [Ancient lakes](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/ancient-lakes) of Washington and got to thinking about ways to deal with invasive species that don't require either people intensive or herbicide intensive work. This led me to wondering about how hard it would be to create an "edible" version of a tumbleweed, make it not easily dispersed, and also able to control local populations of tumbleweed through interbreeding and hybrid sterilization.

Let's start with the first of the three criteria - edibleness. Tumbleweeds are initially graze-able for livestock when young, tender, and green. But as they grow they become woody and their spines stiffen up. Removing the spines and decreasing the woodiness of the stem would result in a much more delectable plant for grazers. For humans, I suspect we'd want a bit more substance. The path of least resistance for making an edible tumbleweed would likely be modifying the root structure into something with higher starch, maybe more carrot like. This [review](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/68/16/4433/4103066?login=true) offers an excellent introduction to what we know about starch synthesis and transport. 

Additionally, the thorns will have to go. Thorns are essentially small branches that terminate before leafing out. In this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220307557) researchers were able to disrupt two genes: THORN IDENTITY1 (TI1) and THORN IDENTITY2 (TI2) in citrus. This disruption resulted in the thorns continuing to grow and leaf out into branches rather then terminating into pointy bits. Removing the thorns would make the tumbleweed more likely to be chewed on by herbivores. 

Tumbleweed being a thistle, it become woody and dies later in the season. This is a problem. Once woody, not much will want to chew on it. It dying is also problematic as once it dies it will eventually break off from the roots and become the iconic tumbleweed. So we have some choices - we can try reducing how woody it gets or we could try preventing it from dying. 

Changing a plant from an annual to a perennial has been a dream of many farmers and scientists for decades. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in creating perennial [grain crops](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/7/2192) and a great deal of effort and planning has gone into making it [happen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138520300534). The genetics behind the different life strategies is still being elucidated. However, there are several candidate pathways including miR156/SPL in which the miR156 rna represses flowering which allows for plant growth. Another candidate is the TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) gene which ["prolongs vegetative development"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110218-024638#_i9). This gene also determines whether axial shoots will become flowers or remain vegetative. Once a branch terminates in a flower, it will no longer grow. However, the actual mechanism behind perennial-ism is not known.

How about the woody stem? A [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13068-017-1007-6) in 2018 looked at tweaking plant cell content to in order to change its composition. This in turns would change the rigidity of the plant and how digestible it would be. They accomplished this by introducing a gene that limits the production of a lignin precursor. Lignin being the primary component responsible for woodiness in plants. They also over-expressed a gene that produces galactan. Galactan is found in tension wood in plants. Increasing its production while decreases woodiness would allow for the plant to remain upright but less woody. Similar modifications could be applied to tumbleweed to tweak its morphology, woodiness, and ability to breakaway from its roots when they die. A tumbleweed that doesn't tumble also doesn't become a fire hazard or road hazard. 

One final change that would be need to be made is that ensuring that these plants cause sterility in local tumbleweed populations. It was be advantageous to be able to plant a perennial tumbleweed that flowers. The pollen from it is then taken far and wide to other tumbleweeds that are then sterilized thanks to the GMO tumbleweed. This approach is being used with [mosquitoes](https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/community/sit/index.html). It'd be really useful to apply this to plants. Similar approaches are used in agriculture to prevent commercial GMO seed from being introduced into the wild and also protecting intellectual property. This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205220301817) offers insight into this process. This [paper](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/71/1/116/5610755?login=true) looks at how pollen can induce unviable seeds. 

While genetic engineering remains a difficult and fraught pursuit. The technology and knowledge is getting to the point where we can begin actively modifying the organisms around us. with relative ease. Many people would argue the risk of these GMOs getting out is too great, I would posit the counter argument that we have already altered the native ecosystems through the introduction of non-natives and that climate change and pollution at a greatly accelerate rate will cause more damage on the ecosystems. By genetically modifying introduced species to be less noxious we might give native species opportunity to adapt. I want to emphasis the word adapt. Everything is now changing rapidly. The ecosystems we enjoy today will not exist in a hundred years thanks to what we have done.
