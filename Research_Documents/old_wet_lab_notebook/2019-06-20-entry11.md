# Purpose:
Practice suturing, try modified anesthesia solution, and sacrifice cukes 

## Summary
I am going to be lazy here and simply say two cukes which had previously had their gonads removed and had the incision sutured shut two months previously were sacrificed and examined. Images below have caption explaining what was happening.
