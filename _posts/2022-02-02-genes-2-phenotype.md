excerpt: "Translating sea cucumber healing abilities to humans"

# The magical properties of animals

Humans have a penchant for thinking that an animals ability to do something or how it looks can magically be transferred to humans if we eat it or turn it into a "medicine". A sad, humerous, and I wish it wasn't true example is how some people believe a Rhino's horn will [help with erectile dysfunction](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180514095509.htm) because it is erect and pointy. Sea cucumbers also have this honor as their ability to heal and regenerate has led to them being turned into [skin beauty products](https://www.amazon.com/BEAUUGREEN-FIRMING-SOLUTION-CUCUMBER-HYDROGEL/dp/B07DR6R1SR). 

While smearing pulped sea cucumber on my [skin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229918304485) isn't very appealing, it does beg the question "how do we go from the genetics of sea cucumber healing to medicine for humans?" 

# Understanding Sea Cucumber Healing and Regeneration

what do we know so far
-  genetics
-  proteomics
-  studies looking for medicinal properties

- [The Other Connective Tissue: Echinoderm Ligaments and Membranes as Decellularized Bioscaffold for Tissue Engineering](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8855-2_14)
- [Marine collagen scaffolds in tissue engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095816692100197X)
- [Novel Marine Organism-Derived Extracellular Vesicles for Control of Anti-Inflammation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13770-020-00319-8)    

# Applying to Humans

how does it apply to humans
- how do the genetics/proteomics of sea cucumber healing translate to humans
- what does the future hold, will better technology allow us to better translate it
