### Cuke Check
The big cuke is looking good. Wound is almost completely healed except for where the stitches are. The little guy, well,
it probably isn't long for this world. Still alive, at least parts of it are. Two things may be contributing to what's happening: 
The first is the size of the wound made, because no guts were found initially, I continued cutting and poking around. The second is that 
the cuke had eviscerated its guts about a month ago and had nothing to eat since. This means either it was starving or absorbing nutrients 
from the water which might explain its peculiar behavior of sticking its body in the stream of bubbles from the air stone.
