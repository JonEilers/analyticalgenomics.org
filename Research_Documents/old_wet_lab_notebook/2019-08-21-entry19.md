## Purpose: 
DNA extraction, purification, and sample QC

__goals__: 
1. test if chloroform suffuciently changes the density of the organic phase to allow for the gel to separate the phases
2. extract dna from lysate
3. precipitate DNA 
4. create fresh batch of lysate
5. Run previously extracted DNA on gel

### QC on previously extracted DNA

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|.4|g|Agarose|
|40|mL|.5X TBE|
|.8|uL|10mg/mL stock Ethidium Bromide|
|5|uL|New England Quickload 1kb DNA ladder #NO4685|

#### Gel layout  

Sample used were the same samples from the 13-08-19 entry.

1. samples and ladder were loaded
2. electrophoresis was started at 55 volts
3. Gel was stopped, checked, and started again at the times below

#### Thoughts
* smears are present, which is awesome. But they are faint considering there is supposed to be at least 500 ng/ul in those samples. Wonder if the DNA settled to the bottom of the centrifuge tubes
* the lowest ladder band represents dna that is ~.5 kb long. Which means the smear represents short fragmented dna. Which is not what I am trying for. Also, no high molecular weight DNA is present higher up on the gel. 


### DNA extraction

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|material|
|---|---|---|
|1|mL|lysate|
|1.1|mL|TE saturated phenol|
|.9|mL|chloroform|

#### Experiment 

1. 2 phase lock gel (PLG) tubes centrifuged 1 min @ 14k rpm
2. 500 uL lysate and 300 uL phenol added to each of 2 phase lock tubes
3. tubes were inverted gently
4. shaker 10 min @ 200 rpm
5. Centrifuged 10 min @ 4k rpm
> gel didn't move in the tubes. The aqueous solution was slightly cloudy with white emulsate at boundary
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-08-21/20190821_133309.jpg"  %}
6. added 200 uL chloroform to each tube
7. inverted gently several times
8. shaker 10 min @ 200 rpm
9. centrifuged 10 mins @ 5k pm
> Worked like a charm. The gel moved and separated the organic and aqueous phases
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-08-21/20190821_140212.jpg"  %}
10. centrifuged 2 new PLG tubes 1 min @ 14k rpm
11. transferred aqueous solutions to 2 new PLG tubes
12. added 250 uL chloroform and 250 uL phenol to each tube
13. inverted gently
14. shaker 10 min @ 200 rpm
15. centrifuged 10 min @ 5k rpm
> gel separated 

### DNA precipitation

Using dilution calculator in Lab.Hacks

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|material|
|---|---|---|
|~1|mL|aqueous phase|
|.5|mL|5M Ammonium acetate|
|3.75|mL|ice cold Absolute ethanol|
|3|mL|ice cold 70% ethanol|

__5 M Ammonium Acetate Preparation__         
 
|qty|unit|material|
|--|--|--|
|9.638|mL|Ammonium Acetate|
|15.362|mL|DI water|

#### Experiment

1. combined aqueous phases into 15 mL falcon tube
> total volume: ~1 mL
2. 1/2 volume 5M ammonium acetate added
> added ~.5 mL, total volume: ~1.5 mL
3. 2x volume ice cold absolute ethanol added
> ~3 mL, total volume 4.5 mL
> Solution became clouded, but nothing large precipitated
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-08-21/20190821_153104.jpg"  %}  
4. added .75 mL absolute ethanol bringing ethanol added to 2.5 volumes 
> total volume 5.25 mL
> Nothing changed
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-08-21/20190821_200346.jpg"  %}  
5. Transferred solution to 3 centrifuge tubes
6. centrifuged 2 min @ 10k rpm
> pellets at the bottom of the tube
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-08-21/20190821_155705.jpg"  %}  
7. transferred supernatent to three separate centrifuge tubes and stored in case
8. added 1 mL 70% to each tube
9. inverted gently
10. centrifuged 5 min @ 10k rpm
11. poured off supernatent
12. air dryed pellets
> eventually pipetted off the few microliters left in the tube
13. added 20 uL elution buffer to each tube
14. placed samples in the fridge

### Lysate of sperm extract 

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|material|
|---|---|---|
|2|mL|sperm extract|
|3|mL|PBS|
|1.5|mL|TLB|
|400|uL|Lysis buffer|

#### Experiment

1. 1 mL each of defrosted sperm extract added to 2 centrifuge tubes
2. centrifuged using generic VWR centrifuge for ~30 seconds
3. supernatent was pipetted off
4. 500 uL PBS was added to each tube
5. steps 2-4 repeated 2 more times
6. after final wash, no PBS was added. 750 uL of TLB was added to each tube
7. tubes were incubated for 1 hr @ 37.5 C in waterbath
> tubes were gently inverted several times during incubation
8. added 200 uL lysis buffer
> same old lysis buffer stock as before. Contains SLS and prot. K 
9. inverted gently
10. incubated 2 hrs @ 55 C 
  > water bath didn't set tempt. reset temp to 55 C  

    > switched to incubation shaker  
      temp: 55 C  
      shaking speed: 100 rpm  

    > start: 1518 on 21-08-19   
      ended: 1054 22-08-19  
      incubation time: ~20 hrs  

#### Results

The sperm extract became translucent and most of the solids were dissolved. However, a yellow color remained. I am not sure why or how it influences the extraction process
