## Purpose:
Make solutions for DNA extraction from sea cucumber sperm and related cells

### Tris HCl pH 8.0

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit| reagent| notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|12.11| g | Trizma base | |
| ~ 100 | ml | DI water | |
| ~ 1.6 | ml | HCl| |

#### Protocol
Added trizma base to 80 ml of water in a beaker. Dissolved it and poured it into a graduated cyclinder and brought to about 100 ml. Calibrated pH meter using standard buffer solutions and then tested pH of solution. Initial pH was 11.32, added 160 drops of conc. HCl to the solution using a pasteur pipette. Estimate that one drop was 10 microliter. Final pH was 8.06

#### Notes
Probably contaminated. Although, at this point I am not sure it matters all that much.

### EDTA .5 M pH 8.0
#### Notes
Found a bottle of premade .5 M pH 8.0 EDTA without any names on it. Sooooo, took 100 mL rather than make my own. 

### EDTA 1 M pH 9.0-9.4

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|36.225| g|Na2EDTA||
|4.0991|g|NaOH||
|~100| ml| DI water||

#### Protocol
Similar steps as discribed above. 

#### Notes
Volume  was already at 104 mL after adding EDTA and NaOH. EDTA wasn't dissolving. Added NaOH to increase pH until everything dissolved. 
Did not keep track of how many NaOH pellets I added. pH was 8.44 when everything dissolved. Added HCl until pH was 8.01

### PBS buffer pH 7-7.4

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|~.5|L|DI water||
|.1184|g|KCl||
|.722|g|Na2HPO4||
|.1233|g|NaH2PO4||

#### Protocol
Similar steps as discribed above. 
pH 7.65 initially, added 10 drops from pasteur pipette which lowered pH to 5.9. Added NaOH till pH 7.07 which is within the acceptable range

### Sodium Lauryl Sarcosine

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|g|Sodium Lauryl Sarcosine||
|~100|ml|DI water||

#### Protocol
Similar steps as discribed above. 

#### Notes
pH of 8.1

## Notes
All reagents were autoclaved for 15 minutes at 121 degrees celsius
