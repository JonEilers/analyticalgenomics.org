## Purpose:
Extract sea cuke sperm DNA using the J. Griffin protocol

### DNA Extraction

#### Materials and Reagents

##### List of Materials

* 6M guandine thiocyanate
* 30% Sarkosyl
* 5M NaCl 
* DTT
* Proteinase K
* .5M EDTA pH 8.0
* Isopropanol
* Ethanol
* 10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0

##### Solutions

* .1M Sodium citrate in 10% Ethanol
* Sperm Wash Buffer
    * 150mM NaCl
    * 10mM EDTA
* Extraction Buffer (~3 mL per a sample)
    * 4.24M guanidine thiocyanate
    * 100mM NaCl
    * 1% Sarkosyl
    * 150 mM DTT
    * 200ug/mL Proteinase K
    * ~240uL DI water for 3 mL of solution

##### For 3mL/sample extraction buffer

|Qty|unit|Material|
|---|---|---|
|2.12|uL|6M Guanidine thiocyanate|
|60|uL|5M NaCl|
|100|uL|30% Sarkosyl|
|.069414|g|DTT|
|240|uL|DI water|
|.0006|g|proteinase K|

> I add the powdered DTT and proteinase K straight to the extraction buffer right before use 

##### Sodium Citrate (for a 3mL sample)

|Qty|unit|Material|
|---|---|---|
|.0436|g|Sodium citrate|
|200|uL|Abs Ethanol|
|~2|mL|DI water|

> Takes awhile to dissolve. Helps to heat it up or place on a shaker

##### Sperm Wash Buffer

For ~20mL per a sample

|Qty|unit|Material|
|---|---|---|
|.1785|g|NaCl|
|400|uL|.5 M EDTA ph 8.0|
|~18|mL|DI water|

> EDTA solution was from 5/1/19

##### 6M Guanidine thiocyanate

For 2.12 mL of 6M G-Th need about 1.503 grams of G-Th. I dissolved 1.5187g of G-Th in ~2mL DI water  
I bought the guanidine thiocyanate on ebay for cheap and it arrived in the sketchiest of bottles. Who knows what's in there ya?

##### 5M NaCl

For 10mL of 5M NaCl I would need 2.923g NaCl. Actual was 2.9302g NaCl dissolved in 10mL 

##### 30% Sarkosyl

For 1 mL I added 300mg of N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt to ~1 mL of water. 
 
##### Proteinase K

.0006 grams proteinase K were added to the extraction buffer solution

##### DTT

.069414 grams of DTT were added

#### Steps
1. cut tip of 10 mL pipette and added ~1 mL thawed sperm extract to centrifuge tube
> extract was thawed in water bath. I forgot about it and the water temp was bath water warm before I began the experiment
2. centrifuged for 10 minutes @3k rpm - vwr 1816 machine
3. poured off supernatent
4. added 1 mL sperm wash

5. vortexed at max setting for 30 seconds
> pellet was too compacted, used pastuer pipette to break it and then revortexed
6. centrifuged for 10 minutes @ 3k rpm
7. repeated steps 3-5 two times
8. added DTT and Prot k to lysis buffer
> prot k = .0026 grams and DTT = .1509 g (opened 2014)
9. poured off supernatent
10. added 1 mL lysis buffer
11. broke pellet using pasteur pipette
12. vortexed briefly
> probably shouldn't vortex after adding lysis buffer
13. poured remaining 2mL of lysis buffer sample into 15mL falcon tube
14. inverted and swirled several times

15. incubated in water bath @56 degrees celsius
> start: 1800  
> invert: 1815  
> invert: 1930  
> stop: 2015  

> a lot of cell debrie remains? Undigested? Needs more time?

16. let cool to room temp
17. added 2.4 mL isopropanol
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2019-09-11/20190911_203117.jpg"  %}  

18. fished out goopy translucent substance and added to 2mLs of sodium citrate solution
19. let sit for ~30 minutes and poured off supernatent. Inverted quite a bit. Goopy stuff became white opaque.

20. added 1 mL 70% ethanol
21. inverted a lot
22. poured off ethanol
23. inverted and air dryed.
> realized the protocol calls for two ethanol washes
24. added 1 mL 70% ethanol and inverted a bunch
25. poured off ethanol and air dried for ten minutes
26. addd ~500 uL of 10 mM tris-hcl ph ~8
27. incubated in 65 C water bath for 1 hr
28. removed and let sit overnight

#### Results
pellets are fibrous and tough. Have not dissolved. Nanodrop results are all low quality and low concentration. Not sure what the stuff is, protein?
