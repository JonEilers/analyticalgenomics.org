Tools and databases are available for predicting how genes will interact with each other and what that might mean. See below for some of those tools and databases.


### Enzymology Tools

The [Enzyme Function Initiative](https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/) website contains a collection of webtools for creating and interacting with sequence similarity networks (SSNs) and genome neighborhood networks (GNNs). These tools originated in the Enzyme Function Initiative, a NIH-funded research project to develop a sequence/structure-based strategy for facilitating discovery of in vitro enzymatic and in vivo metabolic / physiological functions of unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects. 
 
### Protein-Protein interactions

[STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl?sessionId=Llq5aXPG8nBg&input_page_show_search=off) is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases. 

While sea cucumbers are not present in the database, the purple sea urchin is and this may be a useful starting point for investigating the genome of the sea cucumber. 

### Pathway Predictions

[KEGG Mapper](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html) uses KEGG mapping, which is the process to map molecular objects (genes, proteins, small molecules, etc.) to molecular interaction/reaction/relation networks (KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules). It is not simply an enrichment process; rather it is a set operation to generate a new set. From the beginning of the KEGG project, the basic idea was to automatically generate organism-specific pathways by the set operation between manually annotated genome data and manually created pathway maps. Thus, the KEGG mapping set operation has played a role to extend the KEGG knowledge base. In addition, it played another important role to assist integration and interpretation of users' datasets, especially large-scale datasets generated by high-throughput technologies (see: KEGG Mapper tools). There are three basic mapping operations in KEGG: pathway mapping, brite mapping, and module mapping.
